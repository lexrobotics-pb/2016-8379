  > Hardware: Trying to scapegoat hardware *cough* I meant, when above steps fail
    > Close the robot controller app and plug in to robot
    > If the app does not pop up, congrats, it is hardware's problem and just switch up the cables or related devices
    > If the app pops up, see next section
    > If following the next section doesn't work, it may still be the cable's problem, switch it up just to check
  > Configuration: 
    > Stop being lazy and reconfigure everything into a new file
